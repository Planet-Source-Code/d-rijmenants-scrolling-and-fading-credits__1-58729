SCROLLING & FADING CREDITS

Written by

Dirk Rijmenants

You can change
the text color
the text box color
the area of fading in percent
put any image as background

You can align the text
Left, Center or Right

With only two little subs:
Form_Load
Timer1_Timer

Smooth scrolling without flicker
No API's used !
Only basic drawing code

The credits are loaded
from the Credits.txt file
placed in the applications folder

Change it in your credits

If you want a break
just add some empty lines
in the Credits.txt file

If you like the code...
just vote on PSC

Well, thats all folks !


THE END
